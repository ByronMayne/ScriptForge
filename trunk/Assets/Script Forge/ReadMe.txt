Thank you for buying Script Forge!

To use Script Forge is very simple and takes just a few seconds to complete.
To open the editor window go Window -> Script Forge. From there I suggest you
name your scripts according to your preferences. You can choose to give a namespace
but this is not needed. From there you should choose the file path. After these steps
are complete you are good to go. You can hit Generate and your new script will be 
added to your project. If everything worked out the Forge will flash green letting you know.

Once again if you have any questions please feel free to contact me at Byronmayne@gmail.com
